Why “geom”?\nGeometric??\nWhat does labs() stand for?\n\nLabels\n\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\nColoroutlines the bars, butfill` fills in the bars\n\n\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\n\nrating of hike (easy, moderate, difficult)\n\n\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? Some categories are more common than others.\n\nModerate was the most frequent and difficult was the least frequent.\n\n\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\nThe majority of hikes in the Adirondacks were rated ‘moderate.’ Specifically, 27 of the 46 hikes (58.69%) were moderate. Difficult was the least frequent rating, with only 8 ratings.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot?
