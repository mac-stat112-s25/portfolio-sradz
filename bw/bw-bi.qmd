Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
#| fig-alt: 3 box plots comparing temperatures (in Celsius) of three different locations in Australia 

# set-up (load packages, import data)
library(tidyverse)
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv")

# create plot
# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(y=temp3pm, fill=location))+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.7)+
  facet_wrap(~location)+
  labs(title = "Temperatures at 3pm in Three Australian Locations",
       y = "Temperature (*C)",
       fill = "Location",
       caption = "created by Sarah in 2025, data from weatherAUS in the rattle package"
       )+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face="bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        plot.caption = element_text(face="italic"), size = 8)+
    scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha=0.6)
