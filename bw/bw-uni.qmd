Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
#| fig-alt: "Histogram showing the distribution of median rent in the US county."

# load packages and data
library(tidyverse)
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")


# Make a ggplot
ggplot(elections, aes(x=median_rent))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color="black", fill="steelblue2")+
  labs(title = "Median Rent in the United States",
       subtitle = "Distribution of the median rent per county",
       x = "Median Rent ($USD)",
       y = "Number of Counties",
       caption = "Created by Sarah in 2025, Data from 270towin.com")+
